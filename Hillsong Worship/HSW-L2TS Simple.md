Note: This is a simplified version of Look To The Son. The "full" version primarily uses the Lead 3 and is a lot more complicated to play for various stupid reasons mostly related to syncing things up and dealing with problematic sustain pedal behavior.

Engine summary:

* Organ A: 850800080 
* Synth A: Sawtooth +12 arpeggiated

# Pedal state at start

* Swell down
* Control pedal up

# How to play

The intro begins with just strings, so play those in the octave below middle C. The main bell riff is an electric piano in this song triggered on your MIDI controller through the Dual KB channel.

Modulate the control pedal to ~50% during verses, 100% during the chorus and stomp it down when you bring up the swell for the bridge. The control pedal modulates the volume level of the strings.

To play the arp during the chorus, use these chords (C major):

* E-F-G-C (1 meas.)
* C-G-B-C (1 meas.)
* D-G-B-C (2 meas.)

Drop the arp when the synth solo plays.
