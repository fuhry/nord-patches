# How to play

This arrangement is not easy to play. Consider using the [simplified patch](HSW-L2TS Simple.md) instead.

Begin by playing the NL3. Start the song with only slots B and D activated; follow chords while vocalist sings the chorus once. At "Oh we look to the son", add slot A and play the synth solo.

When verse 1 starts, drop slot A so that you are back at just strings in the lower split. Drop the mod wheel down to subdue the sound a bit. Jump it back up at the prechorus.

During the final chord of the prechorus (Gmaj), activate slots A, B and C on the NL3 by pressing them all at the same time, and enable KB hold. When the chorus begins, play chords on your left hand taking care to ensure that the lowest note is the intended bass note, because the pulsing bass is set to mono-low mode.

The arpeggiator chords to play are:

* E-F-G-C (1 meas.)
* C-G-B-C (1 meas.)
* D-G-B-C (2 meas.)

When you reach the final G chord in the chorus, hit the sustain pedal and then disable KB hold. Press the buttons for slots A, B and D on the NL3, then when it's time for the solo, release the sustain and play the F-C-G sequence with your left hand and the synth solo with your right. Mercifully, the synth solo ends with about 4 beats to spare, so you can use your right hand to deactivate slot A on the Lead to go back into the verse. Rinse and repeat for verse 2 and chorus 2.

For the bridge, switch to playing the NS3 in the octave surrounding middle C. When you have a free moment, sweep the mod wheel down on the NL3 to 30% and deactivate slot A. Halfway through the bridge, hit the Extern button on the NS3 to layer the strings on top of the organ. When the vocalist goes back to "Oh we look to the son", drop the organ and switch back to playing the strings on the Lead. Add the pulsing bass (slot A) and arp (slot C) for the final chorus.

Black Rock likes to end this one big, but drop the pulsing bass because the rest of the band will fall off tempo here and your bass will still be awkwardly on tempo.
