# How to play

Start the song by striking a C5 on the NL3 with KB hold on. Fade the mod wheel up slowly and then back down. Play the verse chords on the NS3; this is straightforward. Kill KB hold at the end of the second chorus or so.

Verse 3 ("He shall return in robes of white") I play differently from the track. I add some flair by playing a very churchy sounding pipe organ with the string orchestra sample underneath it. Since the pipe organ is an organ on the NS3, you can fade that up using the swell pedal, and fade up the orchestral strings separately using the control pedal.

I keep the pipe organ fairly quiet and fade it up very slowly, only reaching max volume (which is LOUD) at the final chorus. The strings start to come in at the second half of the "away from the mic" chorus.

I do strongly recommend playing something other than a piano for this - the song gets **really** big towards the end and a nice fat organ and string section give you enough oomph to keep up with the rest of the band, especially drums and vox.

If you don't have a Lead 3 available, you can fudge the string part by turning on KB hold on panel B and playing that part on your MIDI controller.
