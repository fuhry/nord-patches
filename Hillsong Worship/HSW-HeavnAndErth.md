# How to play

Hold an inverted E Major triad and sweep the control pedal up underneath the drum intro. Play the synth solo in the highest octave of the NS3, which is triggering this sound in NL3 slot D, "Annoying Saw". (Hey, it's a really annoying sound in isolation...)

Stomp the control pedal back down to 0% for the verse.

For the first chorus, play through the Panel B channel on your controller. Layer panels A and B together for the second chorus and at some point switch your controller to the Dual KB channel. During the instrumental transition from the chorus to the bridge, stay up and play the piano with your right hand and strings + pads with your left. While the sustain is being held during the last chord before the drop (B), switch back to just panel A on the Stage 3 and play the bridge with the control pedal up.

Add panel B back at some point when the bridge is starting to get big, and drop it again at the final bridge, which you should play heavy on the low end with the control pedal down.
