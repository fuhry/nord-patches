# How to play

Play this song in the main register of the Stage 3. The arpeggiated organ sound adds a lot of texture to the song, and the overall sound is pretty thick thanks to the two very different layered sounds on the Lead 3. The Grand Upright rounds out the synth bits.

For the intro and first verse, leave the mod wheel down on the Stage 3. Jump it up to 30-40% for the prechorus and fade it up to taste for the chorus.

During the choruses, the control pedal should be up, then jump it down for the instrumental leading into the bridge. During the first bridge, move your hands from the NS3 to the NL3 and play the chords (G#m then B) there. Wait until the rest of the band comes back in before switching back to the NS3. Play the lead part an octave above where you play the chorus, and slowly sweep up the mod wheels as you approach the chorus again.

Note: this patch broke when I upgraded to OS 1.24. The control pedal instructions apply to OS 1.22 and older. This will be remapped to the external controller's mod wheel in a future release.

# TODO

NS3 OS 1.24 disables the use of local morph sources on the Dual KB channel. Need to modify this program so I can morph the cutoff for NS3 Synth B from the AP61's mod wheel.
