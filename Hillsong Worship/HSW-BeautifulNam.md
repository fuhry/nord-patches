# How to play

For verse 1, play HSP on the NL3 layered over wind. The track just stays on a D5 here; I like to add some variation but don't play the full chords. I'll usually throw in some D2, DMaj7/A, Gadd9 etc to add some tension building up to the resolution in the chorus.

Coming out of the first chorus, there is a 2 measure rest. I release the chord at the end of the first measure while holding sustain, which is programmed on the NS3 to hold the pad while releasing the wind. It makes for a nice effect as the rest of the band is ready to come in.

At the start of verse 2, switch to playing the NS3, which will trigger the warm pad on the NL3 as well as the local Rhodes through tremolo and flanger effects. Play this with a slightly psychedelic feel.

The bridge can be played just like the track. Don't be a tool by using a grand for this; it sounds better on a Rhodes.

After the bridge has been sung once or twice, activate Panels A and B simultaneously on the NS3 and slowly fade up the swell. At the final chorus, "What a powerful name...", switch to playing your controller through the panel B channel, kick the Leslie into high gear and go wild with a gospel-y organ sound. End big using the organ.
