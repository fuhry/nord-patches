# How to play

Stay mellow on the chords. Keep your right hand in the two octaves above middle C, and your left hand in the octave immediately below middle C.

Play the NS3's local keyboard for the verses, then play with your right hand on your MIDI controller through the Panel B channel for the choruses.

For the ending, avoid low end - keep your hands close to each other and play open chords. Turn off the click and let the vocalists lead the congregation in singing this very slowly.
