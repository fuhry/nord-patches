# How to play

I play this song very heavy on the piano with a strong gospel feel - a significant deviation from the original track.

You can really make the first chorus hit hard by staying close to middle C through the verse, then climbing your way up to the next octave through the last 2 lines of the prechorus. Fade up the control pedal at the same time, which brightens the sawtooth pad just a hair. Start the chorus in this higher register, play a Bbmaj7 instead of the Bb, and for the instrumental interlude hit hard on F3 as the drums come in.

For the instrumental going into the bridge, pull back a lot but add a little bit of piano based texture over the chords.

N.B.: This patch is identical to the one I use for Elevation's "Resurrecting."
