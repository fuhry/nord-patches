# How to play

Instruct the drummer to wait to start the click track until they can follow you. You will be setting the timing on this song.

Using your external keyboard on the Dual KB channel, play the following chord (in the key of Bb):

> F, G, Bb, D, F, G, Bb, C, D

Synth B has KB hold enabled so you can release the chord fully as soon as you play it. Press Panel B and fade up the synth, then play the intro chords. The drummer can start the click once you begin playing chords. When verse 1 starts, fade the arp back down.

The whole song is mostly just piano. The organ is layered in for effect, but I usually keep swell pretty low.

# TODO

Add an ethereal sounding pad in Synth A to sit underneath the piano and arp.
