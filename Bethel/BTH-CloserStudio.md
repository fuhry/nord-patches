# Bethel - Closer (Studio version)

YouTube link: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRDNYuwZdQ)

Engine summary:

* Synth A: Sawtooth w/shape
* Synth B: Sawtooth w/detune

# Pedal state at start

* Control pedal ~30%

# How to play

Follow chords, varying control pedal to modulate the filter cutoff; fading up the control pedal will make the sound brighter. There are a lot of add9s in this rendition.

The bridge is _very_ subdued, so this is the only point where you should have the control pedal at 0%.

# TODO

Make this sound a little warmer and closer to the original.
