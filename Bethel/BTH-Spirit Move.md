# How to play

Activate Holy Spirit pads on NL3 and hold out a Bbadd9 to start the song. At "So come" at the end of verse 1. hold sustain and switch to playing the NS3, triggering Slot D on the Lead. After 4 measures play a Bb triad in the highest register of the NS3 to trigger the arp.

At the end of the pre-chorus, fade up the cutoff on the pulsing pad (NL3-D) using the control pedal and play the chorus synth riff using your MIDI controller over the Dual KB channel.

For the bridge ("so come and blow on through"), jump back to the NL3. Optionally add Wind here.
