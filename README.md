# Nord Stage 3 worship patch set

Since multiple keyboardists at Black Rock now own the Nord Stage 3 I wanted to get this facility going as a sharing platform for my patches.

# My stage setup

Here is a breakdown of my equipment and the MIDI configuration in use. If you have a similar setup, I recommend configuring everything as closely as possible to this, as it will make my patches much easier to play. I'll try and make a note of which sounds are where in the notes for each patch, but it's a lot easier if you can just load them and play right away.

* Main rack:
  * Nord Stage 3 ("NS3") (bottom)
  * M-Audio Axiom Pro 61 ("AP61") (top)
* Side rack:
  * Nord Lead 3 ("NL3")

# Naming conventions and directory structure

All patches are located in subdirectories, sorted by artist and in some cases by album. Patches have a two or three letter prefix indicating the artist.

Nord Stage 3 patches end in `.ns3f`. Nord Lead 3 patches and performances end in `.syx` for SysEx. For as many programs as I can, there are `.md` (Markdown) files containing textual instructions for playing the patch.
